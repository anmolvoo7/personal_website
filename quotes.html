    <h2>The Qouates I like the most</h2>
    <p>Almost Everything, All external expectations, all pride, All
    <br>All Fear of embarrassment or failure..These Things just fall away <br>
        in the face of death Leaving only what is truly important. Remembering That
      <br> you are going to die is best way to avoid the trap of thinking you have
    <br>something to lose</p>
